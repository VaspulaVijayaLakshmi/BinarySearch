You are given:

n stalls positioned at different locations along a line (given as an array of integers).
k cows that you need to place in these stalls.
You want to place the cows in such a way that the minimum distance between any two cows is as large as possible.

Input:
stalls = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]
k = 3

Output:
3



1,2,4,8,9

i have 3 stalls


so i need to place them such that

1         2          4           8         9


One stall i can place like this :

I can place at 2-4 -> 2 - 3 - 4
then the distance will be 

1-2 =1
2-3=1
3-4=1
4-8=4
8-9=1


minimze the maximum means now in the distqnces b/w stalls

nowout of all the maximum distance is 4





now I will place one more stall here:

1         2     3      4     6   7    8         9

I can place at  -> 
then the distance will be 

all distnces are 1
so mimimizing the max is 1.




so what are all the points i have where i can place the cows stalls
so i will put the cows in stall and check all possibilities and backtrck and continue.
Not optimised.




BS+Greedy:



SORT the stall if not already.



the range : 

min distance - low will be starting stall
max - max(stall) - min(stall)

so the max distance would be the starting stall - ending stall

min ? is 1 or? there is only one stall.
they are placed side by side
