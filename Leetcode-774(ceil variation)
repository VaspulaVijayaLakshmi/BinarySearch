744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, 
return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.

Note that the letters wrap around.

For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'


Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Example 2:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Example 3:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
Output: "f"




//keypoints:
line:6 the letters wrap around;
eg:
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "j"
..there is no element greater than "j",so we need to return "c".i.e the first element.




so this is basically the ceil of a letter(like ceil of a number in sorted array)
